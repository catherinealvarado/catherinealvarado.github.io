(My project is not properly displayed on GitHub because my API call makes a hhtp request, but
due to security issues GitHub requires hhtps requests. In order to overcome security server side 
issues I used AWS to host my project.)

-----------------------------

I was inspired to create this project after finding these two D3.js projects.
I added additional features to the globe by making each country in the world clickable 
and by making an api call for economic indicators for a specified country
from the world bank.
